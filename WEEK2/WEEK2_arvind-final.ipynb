    "This shows that likelihood of a word occurring is inversely proportional to its rank. This effect is called Zipf's Law, and suggests that the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. Zipf's law is most easily observed by plotting the data on a log-log graph, with the axes being log (rank order) and log (frequency) resulting in a linear relationship."

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "The Gita is a doctrine of universal truth. Its message is universal, sublime, and non-sectarian al-though it is a part of the scriptural trinity of Sanaatana Dharma, commonly known as Hinduism. The Gita is very easy to understand in any language for a mature mind. A repeated reading with faith will reveal all the sublime ideas contained in it. A few abstruse statements are interspersed here and there but they have no direct bearing on practical issues or the central theme of Gita. The Gita deals with the most sacred metaphysical science. It imparts the knowledge of the Self and answers two universal questions: Who am I, and how can I lead a happy and peaceful life in this world of dualities. It is a book of yoga, the moral and spiritual growth, for mankind based on the cardinal principles of Hindu religion.\n",
      "The message of Gita came to humanity because of Arjuna’s unwillingness to do his duty as a warrior, because fighting involved destruction and killing. Nonviolence or Ahimsa is one of the most fundamental tenets of Hinduism. All lives, human or non-human, are sacred. This immortal discourse between the Supreme Lord, Krishna, and His devotee-friend, Arjuna, occurs not in a temple, a secluded forest, or on a mountain top but on a battlefield on the eve of a war and is re-corded in the great epic, Mahaabhaarata. In Gita Lord Krishna advises Arjuna to get up and fight. This may create a misunderstanding of the principles of Ahimsa if the background of the war of Mahaabhaarata is not kept in mind. Therefore, a brief historical description is in order.\n",
      "In ancient times there was a king who had two sons, Dhritaraashtra and Paandu. The former was born blind, therefore, Paandu inherited the kingdom. Paandu had five sons. They were called the Paandavs. Dhritaraashtra had one hundred sons. They were called the Kauravs. Duryodhana was the eldest of the Kauravs. \n",
      "After the death of king Paandu the Paandavs became the lawful king. Duryodhana was a very jea-lous person. He also wanted the kingdom. The kingdom was divided into two halves between the Paandavs and the Kauravs . Duryodhana was not satisfied with his share of the kingdom. He wan-ted the entire kingdom for himself. He unsuccessfully planned several foul plays to kill the Paan-davs and take away their kingdom. He unlawfully took possession of the entire kingdom of the Paandavs and refused to give back even an acre of land without a war. All mediation by Lord Krishna and others failed. The big war of Mahaabhaarata was thus inevitable. The Paandavs were unwilling participants. They had only two choices: Fight for their right as a matter of duty or run away from war and accept defeat in the name of peace and nonviolence. Arjuna, one of the five Paandava brothers, faced the dilemma in the battlefield whether to fight or run away from war for the sake of peace. \n",
      "Arjuna’s dilemma is, in reality, the universal dilemma. Every human being faces dilemmas, big and small, in their everyday life when performing their duties. Arjuna’s dilemma was the biggest of all. He had to make a choice between fighting the war and killing his most revered guru, very dear friends, close relatives, and many innocent warriors or running away from the battlefield for the sake of preserving the peace and nonviolence. The entire seven hundred verses of the Gita is a discourse between Lord Krishna and the confused Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra near New Delhi, India, in about 3,100 years BCE. This discourse was narrated to the blind king, Dhri-taraashtr, by his charioteer, Sanjaya, as an eyewitness war report.\n",
      "The main objective of the Gita is to help people ‘struggling in the darkness of ignorance’ cross the ocean of transmigration and reach the spiritual shore of liberation while living and working in the society. The central teaching of the Gita is the attainment of freedom or happiness from the bondage of life by doing one’s duty. Always remember the glory and greatness of the creator and do your duty efficiently without being attached to or affected by the results even if that duty may at times demand unavoidable violence. Some people neglect or give up their duty in life for the sake of a spiritual life while others excuse themselves from spiritual practices because they belie-ve that they have no time. The Lord’s message is to sanctify the entire living process itself. What-ever a person does or thinks ought to be done for the glory and satisfaction of the Maker. No ef-fort or cost is necessary for this process. Do your duty as a service to the Lord and humanity and see God alone in everything in a spiritual frame of mind. In order to gain such a spiritual frame of mind, personal discipline, austerity, penance, good conduct, selfless service, yogic practices, me-ditation, worship, prayer, rituals, and study of scriptures, as well as the company of holy persons, pilgrimage, chanting of the holy names of God, and Self-inquiry are needed to purify the body, mind, and intellect. One must learn to give up lust, anger, greed, and establish mastery over the six senses (hearing, touch, sight, taste, smell, and mind) by the purified intellect. One should always remember that all works are done by the energy of nature and that he or she is not the doer but only an instrument. One must strive for excellence in all undertakings but maintain equanimi-ty in success and failure, gain and loss, and pain and pleasure. \n",
      "The ignorance of metaphysical knowledge is humanity’s greatest predicament. A scripture, being the voice of transcendence, cannot be translated. Language is incapable and translations are de-fective to clearly impart the knowledge of the Absolute. In this rendering, an attempt has been made to keep the style as close as possible to the original Sanskrit poetry and yet make it easy to read and understand. An attempt has been made to improve the clarity by adding words or phra-ses, within parenthesis, in the English translation of the verses. A glossary and index have been included. \n",
      "According to the scriptures no sin, however heinous, can affect the one who reads, ponders, and practices the teachings of Gita any more than water affects the lotus leaf. The Lord Himself resi-des where Gita is kept, read, chanted, or taught. The Gita is the knowledge Supreme and the sound embodiment of the Absolute and the Eternal. The one who reads, ponders, and practices the teachings of Gita with faith and devotion will attain Moksha (or Nirvana) by the grace of God.\n",
      "This book is dedicated to my Sadguru, His Holiness Swami Chidanandji (Muniji) Maharaj and all other gurus whose blessings, grace, and teachings have been invaluable. It is offered to the grea-test guru, Lord Krishna, with love and devotion. May the Lord accept it, and bless those who re-peatedly read this with peace, happiness, and the true knowledge of the Self.\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER 1: ARJUNA’S DILEMMA\n",
      "The war of Mahabharata has begun after all negotiations by Lord Krishna and others to avoid it failed. The blind King (Dhritarashtra) was never very sure about the victory of his sons (Kaura-vas) in spite of their superior army. Sage Vyasa, the author of Mahabharata, wanted to give the blind king the boon of eyesight so that the king could see the horrors of the war for which he was primarily responsible. But the king refused the offer. He did not want to see the horrors of the war; but preferred to get the war report through his charioteer, Sanjaya. Sage Vyasa granted the power of clairvoyance to Sanjaya. With this power Sanjaya could see, hear, and recall the events of the past, present, and the future. He was able to give an instant replay of the eye witness war report to the blind King sitting in the palace. \n",
      "Bhishma, the mightiest man and the commander-in-chief of the Kaurava’s army, is disabled by Arjuna and is lying on deathbed in the battleground on the tenth day of the eighteen day war. Upon hearing this bad news from Sanjaya, the blind King looses all hopes for victory of his sons. Now the King wants to know the details of the war from the beginning, including how the migh-tiest man, and the commander-in-chief of his superior army ‘who had a boon of dying at his own will’ was defeated in the battlefield. The teaching of the Gita begins with the inquiry of the blind King, after Sanjaya described how Bhishma was defeated, as follows:\n",
      "The King inquired: Sanjaya, please now tell me, in details, what did my people (the Kauravas) and the Pandavas do in the battlefield before the war started? \n",
      "Sanjaya said: O King, After seeing the battle formation of the Pandava’s army, your son approa-ched his guru and spoke these words: \n",
      "O Master, behold this mighty army of the Pandavas, arranged in battle formation by your other talented disciple! There are many great warriors, valiant men, heroes, and mighty archers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction Of The Army Commanders\n",
      "Also there are many heroes on my side who have risked their lives for me. I shall name few dis-tinguished commanders of my army for your information. He named all the officers of his army, and said: They are armed with various weapons, and are skilled in warfare. (1.07-09)\n",
      "Our army is invincible, while their army is easy to conquer. Therefore all of you, occupying your respective positions, protect our commander-in-chief. (1.10-11)\n",
      "\n",
      "War Starts With The Blowing Of Conch Shells \n",
      "The mighty commander-in-chief and the eldest man of the dynasty, roared as a lion and blew his conch loudly, bringing joy to your son. \n",
      "Soon after that; conches, kettledrums, cymbals, drums, and trumpets were sounded together. The commotion was tremendous. \n",
      "After that, Lord Krishna and Arjuna, seated in a grand chariot yoked with white horses, blew their celestial conches. \n",
      "Krishna blew His conch first, and then Arjuna and all other commanders of various divisions of the army of Pandavas blew their respective conches. The tumultuous uproar, resounding through the earth and sky, tore the hearts of your sons. \n",
      "\n",
      "Arjuna Wants To Inspect The Army Against Whom He Is About To Fight\n",
      "Seeing your sons standing, and the war about to begin with the hurling of weapons; Arjuna, who-se banner bore the emblem of Lord Hanumana, took up his bow and spoke these words to Lord Krishna: O Lord, please stop my chariot between the two armies until I behold those who stand here eager for the battle and with whom I must engage in this act of war. \n",
      "I wish to see those who are willing to serve and appease the evil-minded Kauravas by assembling here to fight the battle.\n",
      "Sanjaya said: O King; Lord Krishna, as requested by Arjuna, placed the best of all the chariots in the midst of the two armies facing Arjuna's grandfather, his guru and all other Kings; and said to Arjuna: Behold these assembled soldiers! \n",
      "Arjuna saw his uncles, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, and other comrades in the army. \n",
      "\n",
      "ARJUNA'S DILEMMA \n",
      "After seeing fathers-in-law, companions, and all his kinsmen standing in the ranks of the two ar-mies, Arjuna was overcome with great compassion and sorrowfully spoke these words: O Krish-na, seeing my kinsmen standing with a desire to fight, my limbs fail and my mouth becomes dry. My body quivers and my hairs stand on end. \n",
      "The bow slips from my hand, and my skin intensely burns. My head turns, I am unable to stand steady, and O Krishna, I see bad omens. I see no use of killing my kinsmen in battle. \n",
      "I desire neither victory, nor pleasure nor kingdom, O Krishna. What is the use of the kingdom, or enjoyment, or even life, O Krishna? Because all those ‘for whom we desire kingdom, enjoy-ments, and pleasures’ are standing here for the battle, giving up their lives. \n",
      "I do not wish to kill my teachers, uncles, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other relatives who are about to kill us, even for the sovereignty of the three worlds, let alone for this earthly kingdom, O Krishna. \n",
      "O Lord Krishna, what pleasure shall we find in killing our cousin brothers? Upon killing these fe-lons we shall incur sin only. \n",
      "Therefore, we should not kill our cousin brothers. How can we be happy after killing our relati-ves, O Krishna? \n",
      "Though they are blinded by greed, and do not see evil in the destruction of the family, or sin in being treacherous to friends. Why should not we, who clearly see evil in the destruction of the fa-mily, think about turning away from this sin, O Krishna? \n",
      "\n",
      "ARJUNA DESCRIBES THE EVILS OF WAR\n",
      "Eternal family traditions and codes of moral conduct are destroyed with the destruction of the fa-mily. And immorality prevails in the family due to the destruction of family traditions.)\n",
      "And when immorality prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupted; when wo-men are corrupted, unwanted progeny is born. \n",
      "This brings the family and the slayers of the family to hell, because the spirits of their ancestors are degraded when deprived of ceremonial offerings of love and respect by the unwanted proge-ny. \n",
      "The everlasting qualities of social order and family traditions of those who destroy their family are ruined by the sinful act of illegitimacy. \n",
      "We have been told, O Krishna, that people whose family traditions are destroyed necessarily dwell in hell for a long time. \n",
      "Alas! We are ready to commit a great sin by striving to slay our relatives because of greed for the pleasures of the kingdom. \n",
      "It would be far better for me if my cousin brothers kill me with their weapons in battle while I am unarmed and unresisting. \n",
      "\n",
      "WHEN GOING GETS TOUGH, EVEN TOUGH ONES CAN GET DELUDED\n",
      "Sanjaya said: Having said this in the battlefield and casting aside his bow and arrow, Arjuna sat down on the seat of the chariot with his mind overwhelmed with sorrow. (1.47)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER 2: TRANSCENDENTAL KNOWLEDGE\n",
      "Sanjaya said: Lord Krishna spoke these words to Arjuna whose eyes were tearful and downcast, and who was overwhelmed with compassion and despair. \n",
      "Lord Krishna said: How has the dejection come to you at this juncture? This is not fit for a person of noble mind and deeds. It is disgraceful, and it does not lead one to heaven, O Arjuna. \n",
      "Do not become a coward, O Arjuna, because it does not befit you. Shake off this trivial weakness of your heart and get up for the battle, O Arjuna. \n",
      "\n",
      "ARJUNA CONTINUES HIS REASONING AGAINST THE WAR \n",
      "Arjuna said: How shall I strike my grandfather, my guru, and all other relatives, who are worthy of my respect, with arrows in battle, O Krishna? \n",
      "It would be better, indeed, to live on alms in this world than to slay these noble personalities, be-cause by killing them I would enjoy wealth and pleasures stained with their blood. \n",
      "We do not know which alternative ‘to fight or to quit’ is better for us. Further, we do not know whether we shall conquer them or they will conquer us. We should not even wish to live after kil-ling our cousin brothers, who are standing in front of us. \n",
      "My senses are overcome by the weakness of pity, and my mind is confused about duty (Dharma). Please tell me what is better for me. I am Your disciple, and I take refuge in You. \n",
      "I do not perceive that gaining an unrivaled and prosperous kingdom on this earth, or even lord-ship over all the celestial controllers will remove the sorrow that is drying up my senses. \n",
      "Sanjaya said: O King, after speaking like this to Lord Krishna, the mighty Arjuna said to Krishna: I shall not fight, and became silent. \n",
      "O King, Lord Krishna, as if smiling, spoke these words to the distressed Arjuna in the midst of the two armies. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE TEACHINGS OF THE GITA BEGIN WITH THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF SPIRIT AND THE PHYSICAL BODY \n",
      "Lord Krishna said: You grieve for those who are not worthy of grief, and yet speak words of wis-dom. The wise grieves neither for the living nor for the dead. \n",
      "There was never a time when these monarchs, you, or I did not exist; nor shall we ever cease to exist in the future. \n",
      "Just as the soul acquires a childhood body, a youth body, and an old age body during this life; si-milarly, the soul acquires another body after death. This should not delude the wise. \n",
      "The contacts of the senses with the sense objects give rise to the feelings of heat and cold, and pain and pleasure. They are transitory and impermanent. Therefore, one should learn to endure them. \n",
      "Because a calm person ‘who is not afflicted by these sense objects, and is steady in pain and plea-sure’ becomes fit for salvation. \n",
      "\n",
      "THE SPIRIT IS ETERNAL, BODY IS TRANSITORY \n",
      "The invisible Spirit (Atma, Atman) is eternal, and the visible physical body, is transitory. The rea-lity of these two is indeed certainly seen by the seers of truth. \n",
      "The Spirit by whom this entire universe is pervaded is indestructible. No one can destroy the im-perishable Spirit. \n",
      "The physical bodies of the eternal, immutable, and incomprehensible Spirit are perishable. There-fore fight, O Arjuna. \n",
      "The one who thinks that the Spirit is a slayer, and the one who thinks the Spirit is slain, both are ignorant. Because the Spirit neither slays nor is slain. \n",
      "The Spirit is neither born nor does it die at any time. It does not come into being, or cease to exist. It is unborn, eternal, permanent, and primeval. The Spirit is not destroyed when the body is des-troyed. \n",
      "O Arjuna, how can a person who knows that the Spirit is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and im-mutable, kill anyone or causes anyone to be killed? \n",
      "\n",
      "DEATH AND TRANSMIGRATION OF SOUL\n",
      "Just as a person puts on new garments after discarding the old ones; similarly, the living entity or the individual soul acquires new bodies after casting away the old bodies. \n",
      "Weapons do not cut this Spirit, fire does not burn it, water does not make it wet, and the wind does not make it dry. The Spirit cannot be cut, burned, wetted, or dried. It is eternal, all perva-ding, unchanging, immovable, and primeval. \n",
      "The Spirit is said to be unexplainable, incomprehensible, and unchanging. Knowing the Spirit as such you should not grieve. \n",
      "Even if you think that the physical body takes birth and dies perpetually, even then, O Arjuna, you should not grieve like this. Because death is certain for the one who is born, and birth is cer-tain for the one who dies. Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable. \n",
      "All beings are unmanifest, or invisible to our physical eyes before birth and after death. They manifest between the birth and the death only. What is there to grieve about? \n",
      "\n",
      "THE INDESTRUCTIBLE SPIRIT TRANSCENDS MIND AND SPEECH \n",
      "Some look upon this Spirit as a wonder, another describes it as wonderful, and others hear of it as a wonder. Even after hearing about it very few people know what the Spirit is. \n",
      "O Arjuna, the Spirit that dwells in the body of all beings is eternally indestructible. Therefore, you should not mourn for anybody. \n",
      "\n",
      "LORD KRISHNA REMINDS ARJUNA OF HIS DUTY AS A WARRIOR\n",
      "Considering also your duty as a warrior you should not waver like this. Because there is nothing more auspicious for a warrior than a righteous war. \n",
      "Only the fortunate warriors, O Arjuna, get such an opportunity for an unsought war that is like an open door to heaven. \n",
      "If you will not fight this righteous war, then you will fail in your duty, lose your reputation, and incur sin. \n",
      "People will talk about your disgrace forever. To the honored, dishonor is worse than death. \n",
      "The great warriors will think that you have retreated from the battle out of fear. Those who have greatly esteemed you will lose respect for you. \n",
      "Your enemies will speak many unmentionable words and scorn your ability. What could be more painful to you than this? \n",
      "You will go to heaven if killed on the line of duty, or you will enjoy the kingdom on the earth if victorious. Therefore, get up with a determination to fight, O Arjuna. \n",
      "Treating pleasure and pain, gain and loss, and victory and defeat alike, engage yourself in your duty. By doing your duty this way you will not incur sin. \n",
      "\n",
      "IMPORTANCE OF KARMA-YOGA, THE SELFLESS SERVICE\n",
      "The science of transcendental knowledge has been imparted to you, O Arjuna. Now listen to the science of selfless service (Seva), endowed with which you will free yourself from all Karmic bondage, or sin. \n",
      "No effort is ever lost in selfless service, and there is no adverse effect. Even a little practice of the discipline of selfless service protects one from the great fear of repeated birth and death. \n",
      "A selfless worker has resolute determination for God-realization, but the desires of the one who works to enjoy the fruits of work are endless. \n",
      "\n",
      "THE VEDAS DEAL WITH BOTH MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL ASPECTS OF LIFE \n",
      "The misguided ones who delight in the melodious chanting of the Veda ‘without understanding the real purpose of the Vedas’ think, O Arjuna, as if there is nothing else in the Vedas except the rituals for the sole purpose of obtaining heavenly enjoyment. \n",
      "They are dominated by material desires, and consider the attainment of heaven as the highest goal of life. They engage in specific rites for the sake of prosperity and enjoyment. Rebirth is the result of their action. \n",
      "The resolute determination of Self-realization is not formed in the minds of those who are atta-ched to pleasure and power, and whose judgment is obscured by ritualistic activities. \n",
      "A portion of the Vedas deals with three modes — goodness, passion, and ignorance — of mate-rial Nature. Become free from pairs of opposites, be ever balanced and unconcerned with the thoughts of acquisition and preservation. Rise above these three modes, and be Self-conscious, O Arjuna. \n",
      "To a Self-realized person the Vedas are as useful as a small reservoir of water when the water of a huge lake becomes available. \n",
      "\n",
      "THEORY AND PRACTICE OF KARMA-YOGA\n",
      "You have control over doing your respective duty only, but no control or claim over the results. The fruits of work should not be your motive, and you should never be inactive. \n",
      "Do your duty to the best of your ability, O Arjuna, with your mind attached to the Lord, abando-ning worry and selfish attachment to the results, and remaining calm in both success and failure. The selfless service is a yogic practice that brings peace and equanimity of mind. \n",
      "Work done with selfish motives is inferior by far to the selfless service. Therefore be a selfless worker, O Arjuna. Those who work only to enjoy the fruits of their labor are verily unhappy, be-cause one has no control over the results. \n",
      "A Karma-yogi or the selfless person becomes free from both vice and virtue in this life itself. Therefore, strive for selfless service. Working to the best of one’s abilities without becoming sel-fishly attached to the fruits of work is called Karma-yoga or Seva. \n",
      "Karma-yogis are freed from the bondage of rebirth due to renouncing the selfish attachment to the fruits of all work, and attain blissful divine state of salvation or Nirvana. \n",
      "When your intellect will completely pierce the veil of confusion, then you will become indifferent to what has been heard and what is to be heard from the scriptures. \n",
      "When your intellect, that is confused by the conflicting opinions and the ritualistic doctrine of the Vedas, shall stay steady and firm on concentration of the Supreme Being, then you shall attain union with the Supreme in trance. \n",
      "Arjuna said: O Krishna, what are the marks of an enlightened person whose intellect is steady? What does a person of steady intellect think and talk about? How does such a person behave with others, and live in this world? \n",
      "\n",
      "MARKS OF A SELF-REALIZED PERSON\n",
      "Lord Krishna said: When one is completely free from all desires of the mind and is satisfied with the Supreme Being by the joy of Supreme Being, then one is called an enlightened person, O Ar-juna. \n",
      "A person whose mind is unperturbed by sorrow, who does not crave pleasures, and who is com-pletely free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called an enlightened sage of steady intellect. \n",
      "The mind and intellect of a person become steady who is not attached to anything, who is neither elated by getting desired results, nor perturbed by undesired results. \n",
      "When one can completely withdraw the senses from the sense objects as a tortoise withdraws its limbs into the shell for protection from calamity, then the intellect of such a person is considered steady. \n",
      "The desire for sensual pleasures fades away if one abstains from sense enjoyment, but the craving for sense enjoyment remains in a very subtle form. This subtle craving also completely disappears from the one who knows the Supreme Being. \n",
      "\n",
      "DANGERS OF UNRESTRAINED SENSES\n",
      "Restless senses, O Arjuna, forcibly carry away the mind of even a wise person striving for perfec-tion. \n",
      "One should fix one’s mind on God with loving contemplation after bringing the senses under con-trol. One’s intellect becomes steady when one’s senses are under complete control. \n",
      "One develops attachment to sense objects by thinking about sense objects. Desire for sense ob-jects comes from attachment to sense objects, and anger comes from unfulfilled desires. \n",
      "Delusion or wild idea arises from anger. The mind is bewildered by delusion. Reasoning is des-troyed when the mind is bewildered. One falls down from the right path when reasoning is des-troyed. \n",
      "\n",
      "ATTAINMENT OF PEACE AND HAPPINESS THROUGH SENSE CONTROL AND KNOWLEDGE\n",
      "A disciplined person, enjoying sense objects with senses that are under control and free from at-tachments and aversions, attains tranquillity. \n",
      "All sorrows are destroyed upon attainment of tranquillity. The intellect of such a tranquil person soon becomes completely steady and united with the Supreme. \n",
      "There is neither Self-knowledge, nor Self-perception to those who are not united with the Supre-me. Without Self-perception there is no peace, and without peace there can be no happiness. \n",
      "Because the mind, when controlled by the roving senses, steals away the intellect as a storm takes away a boat on the sea from its destination ‘ the spiritual shore of peace and happiness. \n",
      "Therefore, O Arjuna, one’s intellect becomes steady whose senses are completely withdrawn from the sense objects. \n",
      "A yogi, the person of self-restraint, remains wakeful when it is night for all others. It is night for the yogi who sees when all others are wakeful. \n",
      "One attains peace, within whose mind all desires dissipate without creating any mental disturban-ce, as river waters enter the full ocean without creating any disturbance. One who desires material objects is never peaceful.\n",
      "One who abandons all desires, and becomes free from longing and the feeling of 'I' and 'my', at-tains peace. \n",
      "O Arjuna, this is the superconscious state of mind. Attaining this state, one is no longer deluded. Gaining this state, even at the end of one’s life, a person becomes one with the Absolute. \n",
      "CHAPTER 3: PATH OF SERVICE \n",
      "Arjuna asked: If You consider that acquiring transcendental knowledge is better than working, then why do You want me to engage in this horrible war, O Krishna? You seem to confuse my mind by apparently conflicting words. Tell me, decisively, one thing by which I may attain the Supreme. \n",
      "Lord Krishna said: In this world I have stated a twofold path of spiritual discipline in the past. The path of Self-knowledge for the contemplative ones, and the path of unselfish work (Seva, Karma-yoga) for all others. \n",
      "One does not attain freedom from the bondage of Karma by merely abstaining from work. No one attains perfection by merely giving up work, because no one can remain actionless even for a mo-ment. Everyone is driven to action ‘helplessly indeed’ by the forces of Nature. \n",
      "Anyone, who restrains the senses but mentally dwells upon the sense objects, is called a preten-der. \n",
      "\n",
      "WHY ONE SHOULD SERVE OTHERS?\n",
      "The one who controls the senses by the trained and purified mind and intellect, and engages the organs of action to selfless service is considered superior. \n",
      "Perform your obligatory duty, because working is indeed better than sitting idle. Even the mainte-nance of your body would not be possible without work. \n",
      "Work other than those done as a selfless service (Seva) binds human beings. Therefore, becoming free from selfish attachment to the fruits of work, do your duty efficiently as a service to Me. \n",
      "\n",
      "TO HELP EACH OTHER IS THE FIRST COMMANDMENT OF THE CREATOR\n",
      "In the beginning the creator created human beings together with selfless service (Seva, sacrifice) and said: By serving each other you shall prosper and the sacrificial service shall fulfill all your desires. \n",

      "The living beings are born from food grains, grains are produced by sacrificial work or duty per-formed by farmers and other field workers. Duty is prescribed in the scriptures. Scriptures (such as the Vedas, the Holy Bible, the Holy Koran) come from the Supreme Being. Thus the all-perva-ding Supreme Being or God is ever present in selfless service. \n",

Such a person has no interest, whatsoever, in what is done or what is not done. A Self-realized person does not depend on anybody, except God, for anything. \n",

Today I have described the same ancient science to you, because you are my sincere devotee and friend. This science is a supreme secret indeed. \n",

Others per-form breathing and other yogic exercises. Some give charity and offer their wealth as a sacrifice. \n",

      "Arjuna asked: O Krishna, You praise the path of transcendental knowledge, and also the path of performance of selfless service (Karma-yoga). Tell me, definitely, which one is the better of the two paths. \n",
      "Lord Krishna said: The path of Self-knowledge and the path of selfless service both lead to the supreme goal. But, of the two, the path of selfless service is superior to path of Self-knowledge, because it is easier to practice. \n",
      "A person should be considered a true renunciant who has neither attachment nor aversion for any-thing. One is easily liberated from Karmic bondage by becoming free from attachment and aver-sion. \n",
      "\n",
      "BOTH PATHS LEAD TO SUPREME \n",
      "The ignorant — not the wise — consider the path of Self-knowledge and the path of selfless ser-vice (Karma-yoga) as different from each other. The person, who has truly mastered one, gets the benefits of both. \n",
      "Whatever goal a renunciant reaches, a Karma-yogi also reaches the same goal. Therefore, the one who sees the path of renunciation and the path of unselfish work as the same really sees. \n",
      "But, true renunciation, O Arjuna, is difficult to attain without Karma-yoga. A sage equipped with Karma-yoga quickly attains Nirvana. \n",
      "A Karma-yogi, whose mind is pure, whose mind and senses are under control, and who sees one and the same Spirit in all beings, is not bound by Karma though engaged in work. \n",
      "\n",
      "A TRANSCENDENTALIST DOES NOT CONSIDER ONESELF AS THE DOER \n",
      "The wise who knows the truth thinks: \"I do nothing at all.\" In seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, breathing; and speaking, giving, taking, as well as opening and closing the eyes, the wise believes that only the senses are operating upon their objects. \n",
      "\n",
      "A KARMA-YOGI WORKS FOR GOD \n",
      "One who does all work as an offering to God — abandoning selfish attachment to results — re-mains untouched by Karmic reaction or sin as a lotus leaf never gets wet by water. \n",
      "The Karma-yogis perform action ‘without selfish attachment’ with their body, mind, intellect, and senses only for the purification of their mind and intellect. \n",
      "A Karma-yogi attains Supreme Bliss by abandoning attachment to the fruits of work; while others, who are attached to the fruits of work, become bound by selfish work. \n",
      "\n",
      "THE PATH OF KNOWLEDGE\n",
      "A person, who has completely renounced the fruits of all works, dwells happily in the City of Ni-ne Gates, neither performing nor directing action. \n",
      "The Lord neither creates the urge for action, nor the feeling of doership, nor the attachment to the results of action in people. The powers of material Nature do all these. \n",
      "The Lord does not take the responsibility for the good or evil deeds of anybody. The veil of igno-rance covers the Self-knowledge; thereby people become deluded and do evil deeds. \n",
      "Transcendental knowledge destroys the ignorance of the Spirit and reveals the Supreme Being just as the sun reveals the beauty of objects of the world. \n",
      "Persons, whose mind and intellect are totally merged in the Supreme Being, who are firmly devo-ted to the Supreme, who have God as their supreme goal and sole refuge, and whose impurities are destroyed by the knowledge of the self, do not take birth again. \n",
      "\n",
      "ADDITIONAL MARKS OF AN ENLIGHTENED PERSON\n",
      "An enlightened person — by perceiving God in all — looks at a learned person, an outcast, even a cow, an elephant, or a dog with an equal eye. \n",
      "Everything has been accomplished in this very life by the one whose mind is set in equality. Such a person has realized the Supreme Being, because the Supreme Being is flawless and impartial. \n",
      "One who neither rejoices on obtaining what is pleasant, nor grieves on obtaining the unpleasant, who has a steady mind, who is undeluded, and who is a knower of the Supreme Being, such a person eternally abides with the Supreme Being. \n",
      "Such a person who is in union with the Supreme Being becomes unattached to external sensual pleasures by discovering the joy of the Self through contemplation, and enjoys transcendental bliss. \n",
      "Sensual pleasures are verily the source of misery, and have a beginning and an end. Therefore the wise, O Arjuna, does not rejoice in sensual pleasures. \n",
      "One who is able to withstand the impulse of lust and anger before death is a yogi, and a happy person. \n",
      "One who finds happiness with the Supreme Being, who rejoices Supreme Being within, and who is illuminated by Self-knowledge; such a yogi attains Nirvana, and goes to the Supreme Being. \n",
      "Seers, whose sins (or imperfections) are destroyed, whose doubts have been dispelled by Self-knowledge, whose minds are disciplined, and who are engaged in the welfare of all beings, attain the Supreme Being. \n",
      "Those who are free from lust and anger, who have subdued the mind and senses, and who have known the Self, easily attain Nirvana. \n",
      "\n",
      "THE THIRD PATH: THE PATH OF DEVOTIONAL MEDITATION AND CONTEMPLATION \n",
      "A sage is verily liberated by renouncing all sense enjoyments, fixing the eyes and the mind at an imaginary black dot between the eye brows, equalizing the breath moving through the nostrils by using yogic techniques, keeping the senses, mind, and intellect under control, having salvation as the prime goal, and by becoming free from lust, anger, and fear. \n",
      "My devotee attains peace by knowing the Supreme Being as the enjoyer of sacrifices and austeri-ties, as the great Lord of the entire universe, and as the friend of all beings. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER 6: PATH OF MEDITATION\n",
      "\n",
      "A KARMA-YOGI IS A RENUNCIANT\n",
      "Lord Krishna said: One who performs the prescribed duty without seeking its fruit for personal enjoyment is a renunciant and a Karma-yogi. One does not become a renunciant merely by not lighting the fire, and one does not become a yogi merely by abstaining from work. \n",
      "O Arjuna, renunciation (Samnyasa) is same as Karma-yoga. Because, no one becomes a Karma-yogi who has not renounced the selfish motive behind an action. \n",
      "\n",
      "A DEFINITION OF YOGA \n",
      "For the wise, who seeks to attain yoga of meditation, or the equanimity of mind, Karma-yoga is said to be the means. For the one who has attained yoga, the equanimity becomes the means of Self-realization. A person is said to have attained yogic perfection when he or she has no desire for sensual pleasures, or attachment to the fruits of work, and has renounced all personal selfish motives. \n",
      "\n",
      "MIND IS THE BEST FRIEND AS WELL AS THE WORST ENEMY \n",
      "One must elevate ‘and not degrade’ oneself by one’s own mind. The mind alone is one’s friend as well as one’s enemy. The mind is the friend of those who have control over it, and the mind acts like an enemy for those who do not control it. \n",
      "One who has control over the lower self ‘the mind and senses’ is tranquil in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, and in honor and dishonor, and remains ever steadfast with the supreme Self. \n",
      "A person is called yogi who has both Self-knowledge and Self-realization, who is equanimous, who has control over the mind and senses, and to whom a clod, a stone, and gold are the same. \n",
      "A person is considered superior who is impartial towards companions, friends, enemies, neutrals, arbiters, haters, relatives, saints, and sinners. \n",
      "\n",
      "TECHNIQUES OF MEDITATION \n",
      "A yogi, seated in solitude and alone, should constantly try to contemplate on a mental picture or just the majesty of the Supreme Being after bringing the mind and senses under control, and be-coming free from desires and proprietorship. \n",
      "One should sit on his or her own firm seat that is neither too high nor too low, covered with grass, a deerskin, and a cloth, one over the other, in a clean spot. Sitting there in a comfortable position and concentrating the mind on God, controlling the thoughts and the activities of the senses, one should practice meditation for self-purification. \n",
      "One should sit by holding the waist, spine, chest, neck, and head erect, motionless and steady; fix the eyes and the mind steadily on the front of the nose, without looking around; make your mind serene and fearless, practice celibacy; have the mind under control, think of Me, and have Me as the supreme goal. \n",
      "Thus, by always practicing to keep the mind fixed on Me, the yogi whose mind is subdued attains peace of Nirvana and comes to Me. \n",
      "This yoga is not possible, O Arjuna, for the one who eats too much, or who does not eat at all; who sleeps too much or too little. \n",
      "The yoga of meditation destroys all sorrow for the one who is moderate in eating, recreation, wor-king, sleeping, and waking. \n",
      "A person is said to have achieved yoga, the union with the Spirit, when the perfectly disciplined mind becomes free from all desires, and gets completely united with the Spirit in trance. \n",
      "A lamp in a spot sheltered by the Spirit from the wind of desires does not flicker. This simile is used for the subdued mind of a yogi practicing meditation on the Spirit. \n",
      "When the mind disciplined by the practice of meditation becomes steady, one becomes content with the Spirit by beholding the Spirit of God with purified intellect. \n",
      "One feels infinite bliss that is perceivable only through the intellect, and is beyond the reach of the senses. After realizing the Absolute Reality, one is never separated from it. \n",
      "After Self-realization one does not regard any other gain superior to Self-realization. Established in Self-realization, one is not moved even by the greatest calamity. \n",
      "The state of severance of union with sorrow is called yoga. This yoga should be practiced with firm determination, and without any mental reservation. \n",
      "One gradually attains tranquillity of mind by totally abandoning all selfish desires, completely re-straining the senses from the sense objects by the intellect, and keeping the mind fully absorbed in the Spirit by means of a well-trained and purified intellect and thinking of nothing else. \n",
      "Wheresoever this restless and unsteady mind wanders away, one should gently bring it back to the reflection of God. \n",
      "\n",
      "WHO IS A YOGI \n",
      "Supreme bliss comes to a Self-realized yogi whose mind is tranquil, whose desires are under con-trol, and who is free from faults. \n",
      "Such a sinless yogi, who constantly engages his or her mind and intellect with the Spirit, easily enjoys the infinite bliss of contact with The Spirit. \n",
      "A yogi, who is in union with the Supreme Being, sees every being with an equal eye because of perceiving the omnipresent Spirit abiding in all beings, and all beings abiding in the Supreme Be-ing. \n",
      "Those who perceive Me in everything, and behold everything in Me, are not separated from Me, and I am not separated from them. \n",
      "The non-dualists, who adore Me as abiding in all beings, abide in Me irrespective of their mode of living. \n",
      "One is considered the best yogi who regards every being like oneself, and who can feel the pain and pleasures of others as one’s own, O Arjuna. \n",
      "\n",
      "TWO METHODS TO SUBDUE THE RESTLESS MIND\n",
      "Arjuna said: O Krishna, You have said that the yoga of meditation is characterized by the equani-mity of mind, but due to restlessness of mind I do not perceive the steady state of mind. Because the mind, indeed, is very unsteady, turbulent, powerful, and obstinate, O Krishna. I think restrai-ning the mind is as difficult as restraining the wind. \n",
      "Lord Krishna said: Undoubtedly, O Arjuna, the mind is restless and difficult to restrain, but it is subdued by any constant vigorous spiritual practice ‘such as meditation’ with perseverance, and by detachment, O Arjuna. \n",
      "In My opinion, yoga is difficult for the one whose mind is not subdued. However, yoga is attai-nable by the person of subdued mind by striving through proper means. \n",
      "\n",
      "DESTINATION OF UNSUCCESSFUL YOGI\n",
      "Arjuna said: The faithful who deviates from the path of meditation and fails to attain yogic per-fection due to unsubdued mind — what is the destination of such a person, O Krishna? \n",
      "Do they not perish like a dispersing cloud, O Krishna, having lost both the heavenly and the worldly pleasures, supportless and bewildered on the path of Self-realization? \n",
      "O Krishna, only You are able to completely dispel this doubt of mine. Because there is none, other than You, who can dispel this doubt. \n",
      "Lord Krishna said: There is no destruction, O Arjuna, for a yogi either here or hereafter. A trans-cendentalist is never put to grief, My dear friend. \n",
      "The less evolved unsuccessful yogi is reborn in the house of the pious and prosperous after attai-ning heaven and living there for many years. The highly evolved unsuccessful yogi does not go to heaven, but is born in a spiritually advanced family. A birth like this is very difficult, indeed, to obtain in this world. \n",
      "There he or she regains the knowledge acquired in the previous life, and strives again to achieve perfection, O Arjuna. \n",
      "The unsuccessful yogi is instinctively carried towards God by virtue of the impressions of yogic practices of previous lives. Even the inquirer of yoga ‘the union with God’ surpasses those who perform Vedic rituals. \n",
      "The yogi, who diligently strives, becomes completely free from all imperfections after gradually perfecting through many incarnations, and reaches the Supreme Abode. \n",
      "\n",
      "WHO IS THE BEST YOGI\n",
      "The yogi, who is devoted to meditation, is superior to the ascetics. The yogi is superior to the Ve-dic scholars. The yogi is superior to the ritualists. Therefore, O Arjuna, be a yogi. \n",
      "And I consider the yogi-devotee ‘who lovingly contemplates on Me with supreme faith, and whose mind is ever absorbed in Me’ to be the best of all the yogis. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER 7: SELF-KNOWLEDGE AND ENLIGHTENMENT\n",
      "Lord Krishna said: O Arjuna, listen how you shall know Me fully without any doubt, with your mind absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, and performing yogic practices. \n",
      "\n",
      "METAPHYSICAL KNOWLEDGE IS THE ULTIMATE KNOWLEDGE \n",

      "DEFINITIONS OF MATTER, CONSCIOUSNESS, AND SPIRIT \n",
      "The mind, intellect, ego, ether, air, fire, water, and earth are the eightfold division of My material energy. \n",

      "O Arjuna, I am the sapidity in the water, I am the radiance in the sun and the moon, the sacred syllable OM in all the Vedas, the sound in the ether, and potency in human beings. I am the sweet fragrance in the earth. I am the heat in the fire, the life in all living beings, and the austerity in the ascetics. \n",
      "O Arjuna, know Me to be the eternal seed of all creatures. I am the intelligence of the intelligent, and the brilliance of the brilliant. I am the strength of the strong who is devoid of selfish attach-ment. I am the lust in human beings that is devoid of sense gratification, and is in accord with Dharma (for the sacred purpose of procreation after marriage), O Arjuna. \n",
      "Know that three modes of material Nature ‘goodness, passion, and ignorance’ also emanate from Me. I am not dependent on, or affected by, the modes of material Nature; but the modes of mate-rial Nature are dependent on Me. \n",

      "WHO SEEKS GOD? \n",
      "The evil doers, the ignorant, the lowest persons who are attached to demonic nature, and whose power of discrimination has been taken away by divine illusive power (Maya) do not worship or seek Me. \n",
      "Four types of virtuous ones worship or seek Me, O Arjuna. They are: The distressed, the seeker of Self-knowledge, the seeker of wealth, and the enlightened one who has experienced the Supreme Being. \n",
      "Among them the enlightened devotee, who is ever united with Me and whose devotion is single-minded, is the best. Because I am very dear to the enlightened, and the enlightened is very dear to Me. \n",
      "All these seekers are indeed noble. But, I regard the enlightened devotee as My very Self, because the one who is steadfast abides in My Supreme Abode. \n",
      "After many births the enlightened one resorts to Me by realizing that everything is, indeed, My (or Supreme Being’s) manifestation. Such a great soul is very rare.\n",
      "Persons, whose discernment has been carried away by various desires impelled by their Karmic impression, resort to celestial controllers and practice various religious rites. \n",
      "WORSHIP OF DEITY IS ALSO A WORSHIP OF GOD\n",
      "Whosoever desires to worship whatever deity — using any name, form, and method — with faith, I make their faith steady in that very deity. Endowed with steady faith they worship that deity, and obtain their wishes through that deity. Those wishes are, indeed, granted only by Me. \n",

      "The ignorant ones — unable to understand My immutable, incomparable, incomprehensible, and transcendental form — assume that I, the Supreme Being, am formless and take forms or incarna-te.

      "I know, O Arjuna, the beings of the past, of the present, and those of the future, but no one really knows Me. \n",
      "All beings in this world are in utter ignorance due to delusion of pairs of opposites born of likes and dislikes, O Arjuna. But persons of unselfish deeds, whose Karma or sin has come to an end, become free from the delusion of pairs of opposites and worship Me with firm resolve. \n",
      "Those who strive for freedom from the cycles of birth, old age, and death — by taking refuge in God — fully comprehend the true nature and powers of the Supreme. \n",

Who is the Supreme Being, and how does He dwell in the body? How can You, the Supreme Being, be re-membered at the time of death by those who have control over their minds, O Krishna? \n",
      "\n",
      "DEFINITION OF SUPREME SPIRIT, SPIRIT, INDIVIDUAL SOUL, AND KARMA \n",
      "Lord Krishna said: The eternal and immutable Spirit of the Supreme Being is also called Eternal Being or the Spirit. The inherent power of cognition and desire of Eternal Being (Spirit) is called the nature of Eternal Being. The creative power of Eternal Being (or Spirit) that causes manifesta-tion of the living entity is called Karma. \n",
      "Various expansions of the Supreme Being are also called Temporal Beings or Divine Beings. The Supreme Being also resides inside the physical bodies as the divine Controller. \n",
      "\n",
      "THEORY OF REINCARNATION AND KARMA \n",
      "The one who remembers the Supreme Being exclusively even while leaving the body at the time of death, attains the Supreme Abode; there is no doubt about it. \n",
      "Remembering whatever object one leaves the body at the end of life, one attains that object. Thought of whatever object prevails during one's lifetime, one remembers only that object at the end of life and achieves it. \n",
      "\n",
      "A SIMPLE METHOD OF GOD-REALIZATION\n",
      "Therefore, always remember Me and do your duty. You shall certainly attain Me if your mind and intellect are ever focused on Me. \n",
      "By contemplating on Me with an unwavering mind that is disciplined by the practice of medita-tion, one attains the Supreme Being, O Arjuna. \n",
      "One who meditates on the Supreme Being ‘as the omniscient, the oldest, the controller, smaller than the smallest and bigger than the biggest, the sustainer of everything, the inconceivable, the self-luminous like the sun, and transcendental (or beyond the material reality)’ at the time of death with steadfast mind and devotion by making the flow of bioimpulses rise up to the middle of the eye brows by the power of yogic practices; one attains the Supreme Being. \n",
      "Now I shall briefly explain the process to attain the Supreme Abode that the knowers of the Veda call immutable; into which the ascetics, freed from attachment, enter; and desiring which people lead a life of celibacy. \n",
      "\n",
      "ATTAIN SALVATION BY MEDITATING ON GOD AT THE TIME OF DEATH \n",
      "When one leaves the physical body by controlling all the senses; focusing the mind on God, and the bio-impulses (Pranas) in the cerebrum; engaged in yogic practice; meditating on Me and utte-ring OM ‘the sacred monosyllable sound power of Spirit’ one attains the Supreme Abode. \n",
      "I am easily attainable, O Arjuna, by that ever steadfast devotee who always thinks of Me and whose mind does not go elsewhere. \n",
      "After attaining Me, the great souls do not incur rebirth in this miserable transitory world, because they have attained the highest perfection. \n",
      "The dwellers of all the worlds ‘up to and including the world of the creator’ are subject to the miseries of repeated birth and death. But, after attaining Me, O Arjuna, one does not take birth again. \n",
      "\n",
      "EVERYTHING IN THE CREATION IS CYCLIC \n",
      "Those who know that the duration of creation lasts 4.32 billion years and that the duration of des-truction also lasts 4.32 billion years, they are the knowers of the cycles of creation and destruc-tion. \n",
      "All manifestations come out of the primary material Nature during the creative cycle, and they merge into the primary material Nature during the destructive cycle.\n",
      "The same multitude of beings comes into existence again and again at the arrival of the creative cycle; and is annihilated, inevitably, at the arrival of the destructive cycle. \n",
      "There is another eternal transcendental existence ‘higher than the changeable material Nature’ called Eternal Being or Spirit that does not perish when all created beings perish. This is also cal-led the Supreme Abode. Those who attain the Supreme Abode do not take birth again. \n",

      "TWO BASIC PATHS OF DEPARTURE FROM THE WORLD \n",
      "This Supreme Abode, O Arjuna, is attainable by unswerving devotion to Me within which all be-ings exist, and by which the entire universe is pervaded. \n",
      "O Arjuna, now I shall describe different paths departing by which, during death, the yogis do or do not come back. \n",
      "Fire, light, daytime, the bright lunar fortnight, and the six months of the northern solstice of the sun — departing by the path of these celestial controllers, yogis who know the Spirit attain the Supreme. \n",
      "Smoke, night, the dark lunar fortnight, and the six months of southern solstice of the sun — de-parting by these paths, the righteous person attains heaven and comes back to earth. \n",
      "The path of light of spiritual practice and Self-knowledge and the path of darkness of materialism and ignorance are thought to be the world’s two eternal paths. The former leads to salvation and the latter leads to rebirth as human beings. \n",
      "\n",
      "TRANSCENDENTAL KNOWLEDGE LEADS TO SALVATION \n",
      "Knowing these two paths, O Arjuna, a yogi is not bewildered at all. Therefore, one should be re-solute in attaining salvation — the goal of human birth — at all times. \n",
      "The one who knows all this knowledge goes beyond getting the benefits of the study of the Ve-das, performance of sacrifices, austerities, and charities; and attains salvation. \n",

      "\n",
      "KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF SUPREME IS THE BIGGEST MYSTERY \n",
      "This Self-knowledge is the king of all knowledge, is the most secret, is very sacred, it can be per-ceived by instinct, conforms to righteousness (Dharma), is very easy to practice, and is timeless. \n",
      "O Arjuna, those who have no faith in this knowledge do not attain Me, and follow the cycles of birth and death. \n",
      "This entire universe is an expansion of Mine. All beings depend on Me (like a chain depends on gold, and the milk products depend on milk). I do not depend on ‘ or affected by ‘ them; because I am the highest of all. \n",
      "Look at the power of My divine mystery; in reality, I ‘the sustainer and creator of all beings’ do not depend on them, and they also do not depend on Me. (In fact, the gold-chain does not depend on gold; the gold-chain is nothing but gold. Also, matter and energy are different as well as non-different). \n",
      "Perceive that all beings remain in Me — without any contact or without producing any effect — as the mighty wind, moving everywhere, eternally remains in space. \n",
      "\n",
      "THEORY OF EVOLUTION AND INVOLUTION \n",
      "All beings merge into My primary material Nature at the end of a cycle of just over 311 trillion solar years, O Arjuna, and I create them again at the beginning of the next cycle. \n",
      "I create the entire multitude of beings again and again with the help of My material Nature. These beings are under control of the modes of material Nature. \n",
      "These acts of creation do not bind Me, O Arjuna, because I remain indifferent and unattached to those acts. \n",
      "The divine kinetic energy (Maya) ‘with the help of material Nature’ creates all animate and inani-mate objects under My supervision, and thus the creation keeps on going, O Arjuna. \n",
      "\n",
      "WAYS OF THE WISE, AND OF THE IGNORANT ARE DIFFERENT \n",
      "The ignorant persons despise Me when I appear in human form, because they do not know My transcendental nature as the great Lord of all beings, and take Me for an ordinary human being. They are unable to recognize Me, because they have false hopes, false actions, and false knowled-ge; and possess delusive qualities of fiends and demons. \n",
      "But great souls, O Arjuna, who possess divine qualities know Me as immutable; as the material and efficient cause of creation, and worship Me single-mindedly with loving devotion. \n",
      "Persons of firm resolve worship Me with ever-steadfast devotion by always singing My glories, striving to attain Me, and prostrating before Me with devotion. \n",
      "Some worship Me by acquiring the knowledge of God. Others worship the infinite as the One in all (or non-dual), as the master of all (or dual), and in various other ways. \n",
      "\n",
      "EVERYTHING IS A MANIFESTATION OF THE ABSOLUTE\n",
      "I am the ritual, I am the sacrifice, I am the offering, I am the herb, I am the mantra, I am the clari-fied butter, I am the fire, and I am the oblation. I am the supporter of the universe, the father, the mother, and the grandfather. I am the object of knowledge, the sacred syllable OM, and the Ve-das. I am the goal, the supporter, the Lord, the witness, the abode, the refuge, the friend, the ori-gin, the dissolution, the foundation, the substratum, and the immutable seed. \n",
      "I give heat, I send as well as withhold the rain. I am immortality as well as death, I am also both the eternal Absolute and the temporal, O Arjuna. (The Supreme Being has become everything) \n",

      "ATTAIN SALVATION BY DEVOTIONAL LOVE \n",
      "The doers of the rituals prescribed in the Vedas, the drinkers of the nectar of devotion, and whose sins are cleansed, worship Me by doing good deeds for gaining heaven. As a result of their meri-torious deeds they go to heaven and enjoy celestial sense pleasures. \n",
      "They return to the mortal world ‘after enjoying the wide world of heavenly pleasures’ upon ex-haustion of the fruits of their good Karma. Thus following the injunctions of the Vedas, persons working for the fruit of their actions take repeated birth and death. \n",
      "I personally take care of both spiritual and material welfare of those ever-steadfast devotees who always remember and adore Me with single-minded contemplation. \n",
      "O Arjuna, even those devotees who worship the deities with faith, they also worship Me, but in an improper way. \n",
      "Because I, the Supreme Being, alone am the enjoyer of all sacrificial services, and Lord of the universe. But people do not know My true transcendental nature. Therefore, they fall into the re-peated cycles of birth and death. \n",
      "Worshippers of the celestial controllers go to the celestial controllers, the worshippers of the an-cestors go to the ancestors, and the worshippers of the ghosts go to the ghosts, but My devotees come to Me, and are not born again. \n",

      "You shall become free from the bondage ‘good and bad’ of Karma and come to Me by this attitu-de of complete renunciation. \n",
      "The Self is present equally in all beings. There is no one hateful or dear to Me. But, those who worship Me with love and devotion are very close to Me, and I am also very close to them. \n",

      "THERE IS NO UNFORGIVABLE SINNER \n",
      "Even if the most sinful person resolves to worship Me with single-minded loving devotion, such a person must be regarded as a saint because of making the right resolution. \n",
      "Such a person soon becomes righteous and attains everlasting peace. Be aware, O Arjuna, that My devotee shall never perish or fall down. \n",
      "\n",
      "PATH OF DEVOTIONAL LOVE IS EASIER \n",
      "Anybody can attain the Supreme Abode by just surrendering unto My will with loving devotion, O Arjuna. \n",
      "Then, it should be very easy for the wise and devout sages to attain the Supreme Being. There-fore, having obtained this joyless and transitory human life, one should always worship Me with loving devotion. \n",
      "Always think of Me, be devoted to Me, worship Me, and bow down to Me. Thus uniting yourself with Me by setting Me as the supreme goal and the sole refuge, you shall certainly come to Me. \n",

That which is contrary to this is ignorance. \n",
      "\n",
      "GOD CAN BE DESCRIBED BY PARABLES, AND NOT IN ANY OTHER WAY \n",
      "I shall fully describe the object of knowledge. By knowing this one attains immortality. The be-ginningless Supreme Being is said to be neither eternal, nor temporal. \n",
      "The Spirit has His hands, feet, eyes, head, mouth, and ears everywhere, because He is all-perva-ding and omnipresent. \n",
      "He is the perceiver of all sense objects without the physical sense organs; unattached, and yet the sustainer of all; devoid of the three modes of material Nature, and yet the enjoyer of the modes of material Nature by becoming a living entity. \n",
      "He is inside as well as outside all beings, animate and inanimate. He is incomprehensible because of His subtlety. And because of His omnipresence, He is very near ‘residing in one’s inner psy-che; as well as far away’ in the Supreme Abode. \n",
      "He is undivided, and yet appears to exist as if divided in beings. He is the object of knowledge, and appears as the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of all beings. \n",
      "The Supreme Being is the source of all lights. He is said to be beyond darkness of ignorance. He is the Self-knowledge, the object of Self-knowledge, and seated in the inner psyche as conscious-ness of all beings, He is to be realized by Self-knowledge. \n",

Material Nature is said to be the cause of production of physical body and organs of perception and action. Spirit (or Consciousness) is said to be the cause of experiencing pleasures and pains. \n",
      "Spiritual Being enjoys three modes of material Nature by associating with the material Nature. Attachment to the three modes of material Nature due to ignorance caused by previous Karma is the cause of birth of living entity in good and evil wombs. \n",

      "Arjuna, know that the mode of passion is characterized by intense craving for sense gratification, and is the source of material desire and attachment. The mode of passion binds the living entity by attachment to the fruits of work. \n",
      "Know, O Arjuna, that the mode of ignorance ‘the deluder of living entity’ is born of inertia. The mode of ignorance binds living entity by carelessness, laziness, and excessive sleep. \n",
      "O Arjuna, the mode of goodness attaches one to happiness of learning and knowing the Spirit, the mode of passion attaches to action, and the mode of ignorance attaches to negligence by covering the Self-knowledge. \n",
      "\n",
      "CHARACTERISTICS OF THREE MODES OF NATURE\n",
      "Goodness prevails by suppressing passion and ignorance; passion prevails by suppressing good-ness and ignorance; and ignorance prevails by suppressing goodness and passion, O Arjuna. \n",
      "When the light of Self-knowledge glitters all the senses in the body, then it should be known that goodness is predominant. \n",
      "O Arjuna, when passion is predominant; greed, activity, undertaking of selfish works, restless-ness, and excitement arise. \n",

      "THREE MODES ARE ALSO THE VEHICLES OF TRANSMIGRATION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL SOUL \n",
      "One who dies during the dominance of goodness goes to heaven ‘the pure world of knowers of the Supreme’. \n",
      "When one dies during the dominance of passion, one is reborn as attached to action (or the utilita-rian type); and dying in ignorance, one is reborn as lower creatures. \n",
      "The fruit of good action is said to be beneficial and pure, the fruit of passionate action is pain, and the fruit of ignorant action is laziness. \n",
      "Self-knowledge arises from mode of goodness; greed arises from mode of passion; and negli-gence, delusion, and slowness of mind arise from the mode of ignorance. \n",
      "They who are established in goodness go to heaven; passionate persons are reborn in the mortal world; and the insipid ones, abiding in the mode of ignorance, go to lower planets of hell, or take birth as lower creatures depending on the degree of their ignorance. \n",

The ignorant cannot perceive living entity departing from the body, or staying in the body and enjoying sense pleasures by associating with the material body.

      "These malicious people cling to egoism, power, arrogance, lust, and anger; and hate Me who dwells in their own bodies and those of others. \n",
      "\n",
      "SUFFERING IS THE DESTINY OF THE IGNORANT \n",
      "I hurl these haters, cruel, sinful, and mean people into the cycles of rebirth in the womb of de-mons again and again. \n",
      "O Arjuna, entering the wombs of demons birth after birth, the deluded ones sink to the lowest hell without ever attaining Me (until their minds change for the better by the causeless mercy of the Lord). \n",
      "\n",
      "LUST, ANGER, AND GREED ARE THE THREE GATES TO HELL \n",
      "Lust, anger, and greed are the three gates of hell leading to the downfall (or bondage) of the indi-vidual. Therefore, one must learn to give up these three. \n",
      "One who is liberated from these three gates of hell, O Arjuna, does what is best for him or her, and consequently attains the Supreme Abode. \n",
      "\n",
      "ONE MUST FOLLOW THE SCRIPTURAL INJUNCTIONS\n",
      "One, who acts under the influence of his or her desires, disobeying scriptural injunctions, neither attains perfection nor happiness, nor the Supreme Abode. \n",
      "Therefore, let the scripture be your authority in determining what should be done and what should not be done. You should perform your duty following the scriptural injunction. \n",

      "CHAPTER 17: THREEFOLD FAITH \n",
      "Arjuna said: What is the mode of devotion of those who perform spiritual practices with faith but without following the scriptural injunctions, O Krishna? Is it in the mode of goodness, passion, or ignorance? \n",
      "\n",
      "THREE TYPES OF FAITH \n",
      "Lord Krishna said: The natural faith of embodied beings is of three kinds: Goodness, passion, and ignorance. Now hear about these from Me. \n",
      "O Arjuna, the faith of each is in accordance with one’s own natural disposition that is governed by Karmic impressions. A person is known by the faith. One can become whatever one wants to be, if one constantly contemplates on the object of desire with faith. \n",
      "Persons in the mode of goodness worship celestial controllers; those in the mode of passion wor-ship supernatural rulers and demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spi-rits. \n",
      "They who practice severe austerities without following the prescription of the scriptures; who are full of hypocrisy and egotism; who are impelled by the force of desire and attachment; who sen-selessly torture the elements in their body and also Me who dwells within the body, know these ignorant persons to be of demonic nature. \n",
      "\n",
      "THREE TYPES OF FOOD \n",
      "The food preferred by all of us is also of three types. So are the sacrifice, austerity, and charity. Now hear the distinction between them. \n",
      "The foods that promote longevity, virtue, strength, health, happiness, and joy are juicy, smooth, substantial, and nutritious. Persons in the mode of goodness like such foods. \n",
      "Foods that are very bitter, sour, salty, hot, pungent, dry, and burning; and cause pain, grief, and disease; are liked by persons in the mode of passion. \n",
      "The foods liked by people in the mode of ignorance are stale, tasteless, putrid, rotten, refuses, and impure (such as meat and alcohol). \n",
      "\n",
      "THREE TYPES OF SACRIFICES \n",
      "Selfless service enjoined by the scriptures, and performed without the desire for the fruit, with a firm belief and conviction that it is a duty, is in the mode of goodness. \n",
      "Selfless service that is performed only for show, and aiming for fruit, know that to be in the mode of passion, O Arjuna. \n",
      "Selfless service that is performed without following the scripture, in which no food is distributed, which is devoid of mantra, faith, and gift, is said to be in the mode of ignorance. \n",
      "\n",
      "AUSTERITY OF THOUGHT, WORD, AND DEED \n",
      "The worship of celestial controllers, the priest, guru, and the wise; purity, honesty, celibacy, and nonviolence; these are said to be the austerity of deed. \n",
      "Speech that is non-offensive, truthful, pleasant, beneficial, and is used for the regular study of scriptures is called the austerity of word. \n",
      "The serenity of mind, gentleness, equanimity, self-control, and the purity of thought, these are called the austerity of thought. \n",
      "\n",
      "THREE TYPES OF AUSTERITY \n",
      "The above mentioned threefold austerity (of thought, word, and deed) practiced by yogis with supreme faith, without a desire for the fruit, is said to be in the mode of goodness. \n",
      "Austerity that is performed for gaining respect, honor, reverence, and for the sake of show that yields an uncertain and temporary result is said to be in the mode of passion. \n",
      "Austerity performed with foolish stubbornness, or with self-torture, or for harming others, is de-clared to be in the node of ignorance. \n",
      "\n",
      "THREE TYPES OF CHARITY \n",
      "Charity that is given as a matter of duty, to a deserving candidate who does nothing in return, at the right place and time, is considered to be charity in the mode of goodness. \n",
      "Charity that is given unwillingly, or to get something in return, or looking for some fruit, is said to be in the mode of passion. \n",
      "Charity that is given at a wrong place and time, and to unworthy persons; or without paying res-pect to the receiver or with ridicule, is said to be in the mode of ignorance. \n",
      "\n",
      "THREEFOLD NAME OF GOD \n",
      "The Spirit is all pervading. The persons with divine qualities, the Vedas, and the selfless service were created by and from the Spirit. \n",
      "Therefore, acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity prescribed in the scriptures are always commen-ced by uttering any one of the many names of God such as OM, Amen, or Allah by the knowers of the Supreme. \n",
      "The seekers of salvation perform various types of sacrifice, charity, and austerity by uttering \"He is all\" without seeking a reward. \n",
      "The word \"Truth\" is used in the sense of Reality and goodness. The word Truth is also used for an auspicious act, O Arjuna. \n",
      "Faith in sacrifice, charity, and austerity is also called Truth. The selfless service for the sake of the Supreme is verily termed as Truth. \n",
      "Whatever is done without faith ‘whether it is sacrifice, charity, austerity, or any other act’ is use-less. It has no value here or hereafter, O Arjuna. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER 18: SALVATION THROUGH RENUNCIATION\n",
      "Arjuna said: I wish to know the nature of renunciation and sacrifice, and the difference between the two, O Lord Krishna. \n",
      "\n",
      "DEFINITION OF RENUNCIATION AND SACRIFICE \n",
      "Lord Krishna said: The sages define renunciation as abstaining from all work for personal profit. The wise define sacrifice as the sacrifice of, and the freedom from, the selfish attachment to the fruits of all work. \n",
      "Some philosophers say that all work is full of faults and should be given up, while others say that acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned. \n",
      "O Arjuna, listen to My conclusion about sacrifice. Sacrifice is said to be of three types. \n",
      "Acts of service, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned, but should be performed, because service, charity, and austerity are the purifiers of the wise. \n",
      "Even these obligatory works should be performed without attachment to the fruits. This is My de-finite supreme advice, O Arjuna. \n",
      "\n",
      "THREE TYPES OF SACRIFICE \n",
      "Giving up one's duty is not proper. The abandonment of obligatory work is due to delusion, and is declared to be in the mode of ignorance. \n",
      "One who abandons duty merely because it is difficult, or because of fear of bodily trouble, does not get the benefits of sacrifice by performing such a sacrifice in the mode of passion. \n",
      "Obligatory work performed as duty, renouncing selfish attachment to the fruit, is alone regarded to be sacrifice in the mode of goodness, O Arjuna. \n",
      "The one who neither hates a disagreeable work, nor is attached to an agreeable work, is conside-red a renunciant (Tyagi), imbued with the mode of goodness, intelligent, and free from all doubts about the Supreme Being. \n",
      "Human beings cannot completely abstain from work. Therefore, the one who completely renoun-ces the selfish attachment to the fruits of all works is considered a renunciant. \n",
      "The threefold fruit of works — desirable, undesirable, and mixed — accrues after death to the one who is not a renunciant (Tyagi), but never to a Tyagi. \n",
      "\n",
      "FIVE CAUSES OF ANY ACTION \n",
      "Learn from Me, O Arjuna, the five causes, as described in the Sankhya doctrine, for the accom-plishment of all actions. They are: The physical body, the seat of Karma; the modes of material Nature, the doer; the eleven organs of perception and action, the instruments; various bio-impul-ses; and the fifth is the presiding deities of the eleven organs. \n",
      "Whatever action, whether right or wrong, one performs by thought, word, and deed; these are its five causes. \n",
      "Therefore, the ignorant one who considers one’s body or the soul as the sole agent due to imper-fect knowledge does not understand. \n",
      "The one who is free from the notion of doership, and whose intellect is not polluted by the desire to reap the fruit; even after slaying these people, he or she neither slays nor is bound by the act of killing. \n",
      "The subject, the object, and the knowledge of the object are the threefold driving force to an acti-on. The eleven organs; the act, and the agent or the modes of material Nature are the three com-ponents of action. \n",
      "\n",
      "THREE TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE \n",
      "Self-knowledge, action), and agent are said to be of three types according to Sankhya doctrine. Hear duly about these also. \n",
      "The knowledge by which one sees a single immutable Reality in all beings as undivided in the di-vided; such knowledge is in the mode of goodness. \n",
      "The knowledge by which one sees different realities of various types among all beings as separate from one another; consider that knowledge to be in the mode of passion. \n",
      "The irrational, baseless, and worthless knowledge by which one clings to one single effect (such as the body) as if it is everything; such knowledge is declared to be in the mode of darkness of ig-norance.\n",
      "\n",
      "THREE TYPES OF ACTION \n",
      "The obligatory duty performed without likes and dislikes, and without selfish motives and attach-ment to enjoy the fruit, is said to be in the mode of goodness. \n",
      "Action performed with ego, with selfish motives, and with too much effort; is declared to be in the mode of passion. \n",
      "Action that is undertaken because of delusion; diSelf-realization egarding consequences, loss, in-jury to others, as well as one’s own ability is said to be in the mode of ignorance. \n",
      "\n",
      "THREE TYPES OF AGENT \n",
      "The agent who is free from attachment, is non-egotistic, endowed with resolve and enthusiasm, and unperturbed in success or failure is called good. \n",
      "The agent who is impassioned, attached to the fruits of their work, greedy, violent, impure, and is affected by joy and sorrow is called passionate. \n",
      "The undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, wicked, malicious, lazy, depressed, and procrastinating agent is called ignorant. \n",
      "\n",
      "THREE TYPES OF INTELLECT \n",
      "Now hear the threefold division of intellect and resolve, based on modes of material Nature, as explained by Me fully and separately, O Arjuna. \n",
      "O Arjuna, the intellect by which one understands the path of work and the path of renunciation, right and wrong action, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation, that intellect is in the mode of goodness. \n",
      "The intellect by which one cannot distinguish between righteousness (Dharma) and unrighteous-ness (Adharma), and right and wrong action; that intellect is in the mode of passion, O Arjuna. \n",
      "The intellect ‘when covered by ignorance’ accepts unrighteousness (Adharma) as righteousness (Dharma), and thinks everything to be that which it is not, is in the mode of ignorance, O Arjuna. \n",
      "\n",
      "THREE TYPES OF RESOLVE, AND THE FOUR GOALS OF HUMAN LIFE\n",
      "The resolve by which one manipulates the functions of the mind, Prana (bio-impulses), and sen-ses for God-realization only; that resolve is in the mode of goodness, O Arjuna. \n",
      "The resolve by which a person, craving for the fruits of work, clings to duty, accumulating wealth, and enjoyment with great attachment; that resolve, O Arjuna, is in the mode of passion. \n",
      "The resolve by which a dull person does not give up sleep, fear, grief, despair, and carelessness; that resolve is in the mode of ignorance, O Arjuna. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THREE TYPES OF PLEASURE \n",
      "And now hear from Me, O Arjuna, about the threefold pleasure. The pleasure one enjoys from spiritual practice results in cessation of all sorrows. \n",
      "The pleasure that appears as poison in the beginning, but is like nectar in the end, comes by the grace of Self-knowledge, and is in the mode of goodness. \n",
      "Sensual pleasures appear as nectar in the beginning, but become poison in the end; such pleasures are in the mode of passion. \n",
      "Pleasure that confuses a person in the beginning and in the end; which comes from sleep, lazi-ness, and carelessness; such pleasure is said to be in the mode of ignorance. \n",
      "There is no being, either on the earth or among the celestial controllers in the heaven, who can re-main free from these three modes of material Nature. \n",
      "\n",
      "DIVISION OF LABOR IS BASED ON ONE’S ABILITY\n",
      "The division of human labor is also based on the qualities inherent in peoples’ nature or their ma-ke-up. \n",
      "Those who have serenity, self control, austerity, purity, patience, honesty, transcendental know-ledge, transcendental experience, and belief in God are labeled as intellectuals (Braahmans). \n",
      "Those having the qualities of heroism, vigor, firmness, dexterity, not fleeing from battle, charity, and administrative skills are called leaders or protectors (Kshatriyas). \n",
      "Those who are good in cultivation, cattle rearing, business, trade, finance, and industry are known as business men (Vaishyas). Those who are very good in service and labor type work only are classed as workers (Shudras). \n",
      "\n",
      "ATTAINMENT OF SALVATION THROUGH DUTY, DISCIPLINE, AND DEVOTION \n",
      "One can attain the highest perfection by devotion to one’s natural work. Listen to Me how one at-tains perfection while engaged in one’s natural work. \n",
      "One attains perfection by worshipping the Supreme Being ‘from whom all beings originate, and by whom all this universe is pervaded’ through performance of one’s natural duty for Him. \n",
      "One’s inferior natural work is better than superior unnatural work even though well performed. One who does the work ordained by one’s inherent nature, without any selfish motive, incurs no sin (or Karmic reaction). \n",
      "One’s natural work, even though defective, should not be abandoned; because all undertakings are enveloped by defects as fire is covered by smoke, O Arjuna. \n",
      "The person whose mind is always free from selfish attachment, who has subdued the mind and senses, and who is free from desires attains the supreme perfection of freedom from the bondage of Karma by renouncing selfish attachment to the fruits of work. \n",
      "Learn from Me briefly, O Arjuna, how one who has attained such perfection, or the freedom from the bondage of Karma, attains Supreme Being, the goal of transcendental knowledge. \n",
      "Endowed with purified intellect, subduing the mind with firm resolve, turning away from sound and other objects of the senses, giving up likes and dislikes; living in solitude, eating lightly, con-trolling the mind, speech, and organs of action, ever absorbed in yoga of meditation, taking refu-ge in detachment; and after relinquishing egotism, violence, pride, lust, anger, and proprietorship; one becomes peaceful, free from the notion of \"I, me, and my\", and fit for attaining oneness with the Supreme Being. \n",
      "Absorbed in the Supreme Being, the serene one neither grieves nor desires; becoming impartial to all beings, one obtains the highest devotional love for God. \n",
      "By devotion one truly understands what and who I am in essence. Having known Me in essence, one immediately merges with Me. \n",
      "A Karma-yogi devotee attains the eternal immutable abode by My grace ‘even while doing all du-ties’ just by taking refuge in Me (by surrendering all action to Me with loving devotion). \n",
      "Sincerely offer all actions to Me, set Me as your supreme goal, and completely depend on Me. Always fix your mind on Me, and resort to Karma-yoga. \n",
      "You shall overcome all difficulties by My grace when your mind becomes fixed on Me. But, if you do not listen to Me due to ego, you shall perish. \n",
      "\n",
      "THE KARMIC BONDAGE \n",
      "If due to ego you think: I shall not fight; this resolve of yours is vain. Because your own nature will compel you to fight. \n",
      "O Arjuna, you are controlled by your own nature-born Karmic impressions. Therefore, you shall do ‘even against your will’ what you do not wish to do out of delusion. \n",
      "\n",
      "WE BECOME THE PUPPETS OF OUR OWN FREEWILL \n",
      "The Supreme Lord — as the controller abiding in the inner psyche of all beings — causes them to work out their Karma like a puppet (of Karma created by the free will) mounted on a machine. \n",
      "Seek refuge in the Supreme Lord alone with loving devotion, O Arjuna. By His grace you shall attain supreme peace and the Eternal Abode. \n",
      "Thus the knowledge that is more secret than the secret has been explained to you by Me. After fully reflecting on this, do as you wish. \n",
      "\n",
      "PATH OF SURRENDER IS THE ULTIMATE PATH TO GOD \n",
      "Hear once again My most secret, supreme word. You are very dear to Me, therefore, I shall tell this for your benefit. \n",
      "Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, offer service to Me, bow down to Me, and you shall cer-tainly reach Me. I promise you because you are My very dear friend. \n",
      "Set aside all meritorious deeds and religious rituals, and just surrender completely to My will with firm faith and loving devotion. I shall liberate you from all sins, the bonds of Karma. Do not grie-ve. \n",
      "This knowledge should never be spoken by you to one who is devoid of austerity, who is without devotion, who does not desire to listen, or who speaks ill of Me. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE HIGHEST SERVICE TO GOD, AND THE BEST CHARITY \n",
      "The one who shall propagate this supreme secret philosophy ‘the transcendental knowledge of the Gita’ amongst My devotees, shall be performing the highest devotional service to Me, and shall certainly come to Me. No other person shall do a more pleasing service to Me, and no one on the earth shall be more dear to Me. \n",
      "\n",
      "GRACE OF THE GITA \n",
      "I promise the study of this sacred dialogue of ours will be equivalent to worshipping Me with knowledge-sacrifice. \n",
      "Whoever hears this sacred dialogue with faith and without cavil becomes free from sin, and at-tains heaven — the higher worlds of those whose actions are pure and virtuous. \n",
      "O Arjuna, did you listen to this with single-minded attention? Has your delusion born of ignoran-ce been completely destroyed? \n"
